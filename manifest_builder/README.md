# Manifest builder

This allows you to generate a `manifest.json` file for your talon package, which will list all the actions, modes, tags, lists, and other talon entities the package "contributes" and "depends" on.

# Usage

1. Define relative folders which this should apply to in `manifest_builder.py`.
2. Run `python ./manifest_builder.py`
