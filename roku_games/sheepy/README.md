## Instructions
Put this folder along with the `roku-talon-shared` folder in your `[TALON_HOME]/user` directory.

## If you have free version of Talon
Say "game mode" while in game to start.
Say "game exit" while in game to exit.

## If you have Talon beta + parrot
You will need to change the parrot noises to your own.
Say "parrot mode" while in game to start.
Say "game exit" while in game to exit.

## Optional dependencies
- Something to use the "X" button on a xbox controller. e.g. "Playability" app to handle input for additional speed boosts. shift doesn't trigger multiple speed boosts, but X on the controller does.
